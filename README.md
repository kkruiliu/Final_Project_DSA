 The quiz bowl is a one-player game in which the user selects one of the categories to test his or her knowledge on that subject. The quiz consists of ten questions ranging in difficulty from 1 to 5. The player begins with level 1 difficulty and progresses to the next level difficulty after correctly answering two questions of the same difficulty level. It will also move the player to the next level of difficulty if the player gets four questions wrong at the same level of difficulty. This process continues until the player has answered ten questions. After you've answered each question, the command window will indicate whether you've answered it correctly with a comment. Following the completion of the quiz, a score will be displayed on the screen. The total score is determined by summing all of the points gained. The difficulty level of a question is represented by its points. A level 2 question, for example, is worth 2 points, whereas a level 3 question is worth 3 points.
The multi-player feature is included in the second version of the quiz bowl program. The application will inquire as to how many participants are taking part in the game. The program functions in the same way as the previous version. At the conclusion of the program, the results of all players will be displayed.
